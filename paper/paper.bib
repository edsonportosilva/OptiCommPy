@article{Marcuse1997a,
abstract = {We report here on our investigations of the Manakov-polarization mode dispersion (PMD) equation which can be used to model both nonreturn-to-zero (NRZ) and soliton signal propagation in optical fibers with randomly varying birefringence. We review the derivation of the Manakov-PMD equation from the coupled nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation, and We discuss the physical meaning of its terms. We discuss our numerical approach for solving this equation, and we apply this approach to both NRZ and soliton propagation. We show by comparison with the coupled nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation, integrated with steps that are short enough to follow the detailed polarization evolution, that our approach is orders of magnitude faster with no loss of accuracy. Finally, we compare our approach to the widely used coarse-step method and demonstrate that the coarse-step method is both efficient and valid.},

@article{Savory2010,
abstract = {Digital coherent receivers have caused a revolution in the design of optical transmission systems, due to the subsystems and algorithms embedded within such a receiver. After giving a high-level overview of the subsystems, the optical front end, the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and the digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms, which relax the tolerances on these subsystems are discussed. Attention is then turned to the compensation of transmission impairments, both static and dynamic. The discussion of dynamic-channel equalization, which forms a significant part of the paper, includes a theoretical analysis of the dual-polarization constant modulus algorithm, where the control surfaces several different equalizer algorithms are derived, including the constant modulus, decision-directed, trained, and the radially directed equalizer for both polarization division multiplexed quadriphase shift keyed (PDM-QPSK) and 16 level quadrature amplitude modulation (PDM-16-QAM). Synchronization algorithms employed to recover the timing and carrier phase information are then examined, after which the data may be recovered. The paper concludes with a discussion of the challenges for future coherent optical transmission systems. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

@article{Essiambre2010,
abstract = {We describe a method to estimate the capacity limit of fiber-optic communication systems (or “fiber channels”) based on information theory. This paper is divided into two parts. Part 1 reviews fundamental concepts of digital communications and information theory. We treat digitization and modulation followed by information theory for channels both without and with memory. We provide explicit relationships between the commonly used signal-to-noise ratio and the optical signal-to-noise ratio. We further evaluate the performance of modulation constellations such as quadrature-amplitude modulation, combinations of amplitude-shift keying and phase-shift keying, exotic constellations, and concentric rings for an additive white Gaussian noise channel using coherent detection. Part 2 is devoted specifically to the “fiber channel.” We review the physical phenomena present in transmission over optical fiber networks, including sources of noise, the need for optical filtering in optically-routed networks, and, most critically, the presence of fiber Kerr nonlinearity. We describe various transmission scenarios and impairment mitigation techniques, and define a fiber channel deemed to be the most relevant for communication over optically-routed networks. We proceed to evaluate a capacity limit estimate for this fiber channel using ring constellations. Several scenarios are considered, including uniform and optimized ring constellations, different fiber dispersion maps, and varying transmission distances. We further present evidences that point to the physical origin of the fiber capacity limitations and provide a comparison of recent record experiments with our capacity limit estimation. {\textcopyright} 2010, IEEE.},

@article{Alvarado2018,
abstract = {In this paper, achievable information rates (AIR) for fiber optical communications are discussed. It is shown that AIRs such as the mutual information and generalized mutual information are good design metrics for coded optical systems. The theoretical predictions of AIRs are compared to the performance of modern codes including low-parity density check and polar codes. Two different computation methods for these AIRs are also discussed: Monte-Carlo integration and Gauss-Hermite quadrature. Closed-form ready-to-use approximations for such computations are provided for arbitrary constellations and the multidimensional AWGN channel. The computation of AIRs in optical experiments and simulations is also discussed.},
